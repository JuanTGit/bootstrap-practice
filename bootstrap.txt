Bootstrap 5 & CSS Grid

framework: Prebuilt collection of tools, libraries, guidelines, and best practices 
    organized in a structured and cohesive manner to help developers build and maintain complex 
    applications more efficiently.

Bootstrap: is a front-end framework that simplifies the process of front-end web development by providing 
    a foundation that developers can build upon, speeding up the creation of responsive and visually appealing 
    websites and web applications.

Bootstrap's main selling point is the responsive grid system built into the framework when using Bootstrap we only have to
worry about 6 breakpoints

    Media Query: A CSS tool that can be used to modify websites on a device depending on screen size
        Syntax: When screen is at or above 576 px
        @media(min-width:576){
            display:block;
            margin:0 auto;
            max-width:100%;
            height: 100vh;
        }

Bootstrap's grid tier system is how we use media queries. Built using flexbox and has 3 specific parts.
    
    Containers: Responsive class that helps center and horizontally pad the content of your site

    Rows: Rows are basic wrappers for the final portion of the system - columns. They spread across the entire
        width of the page. for a total of 12 possible spaces(similar to a block level element).

    Columns: Columns are the most flexible portion of the tiered Bootstrap grid system. They fill the in the rows
        horizontally until all available space is taken up. Up to 12 spots total.

    Syntax example:

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class"col">First</div>
            <div class"col">Second</div>
            <div class"col">Third</div>
            <div class"col">Fourth</div>
        <div/>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-8">co1-8</div>
            <div class="col-4">co1-4</div>
        <div/>
    <div/>

    Tips: 
        .container
            .row
                .col*3
        cmd + shift + l = grabs all highlighted objects
        option + shift + up/down = copy line up/down
